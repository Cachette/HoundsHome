								<h3>Marian B. Sitter Bio:</h3>
								<h4>I was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico, due to my father being in the military. We moved almost every year, and I have lived in numerous states, along with the Philippines, Guam, Panama, and South Korea. My father retired in Orlando, where I attended high school. I married very young, and again moved, to Savannah, GA, then Miami, FL, where I began studying Criminal Justice. We were transferred to Tampa and I was hired by the Tampa Police Dept., where I stayed for 17 years, before marrying an active duty military officer. I am back in Florida, where I choose to stay. Throughout my life, my pets were the stabilizing force, as I grew up with dogs, cats, fish and birds. I adopted my first horse, when I was 25 years old, and owned and adored him until he passed away in 2002. During my travels, my dear friend kept, and loved him, so he could remain in my life. I adopted my current horse in 2015, from RVR horse rescue. Phoenix was a starvation case, but has since gained more weight than necessary, but I adore him. I currently work at Home Depot, which has been wonderful to me. I work early mornings, which would enable me to pet sit, during the evenings and overnights.</h4>
