								<h3>Arrington C.</h3>
								<h4>"I have had pets my whole life.  I was born into a family that had 2 yorkies. Ive had cockatiels, a parakeet, many beta fish, dogs, cats, ferrets, rats, and I've worked with horses. Taking care of other peoples pets isn't new for me, I've been doing it for years for close friends and family, and currently work at a doggie day care."

								<h3>Marian B.</h3>
								<h4>"Throughout my life, my pets were the stabilizing force, as I grew up with dogs, cats, fish and birds. I adopted my first horse, when I was 25 years old, and owned and adored him until he passed away in 2002."

								<h3>John L.</h3>
								<h4>"I pride myself on my ability to handle stressful situations, and I enjoy the feeling I get when I know that a business and its employees can feel safe when I was on duty. I can sympathize with families who have reservations about leaving the care and welfare of a furry member of their family with a total stranger. Our small family includes a shaggy black Shih-Tzu named Zoey."

								<h3>Brooke H.</h3>
								<h4>"Animals of all kinds have always been my soft spot. I can't get enough of them! Whether I'm at home or at work. I'm currently the proud pet parent of a dog, cat, rabbit and Betta fish."

								<h3>Cody S.</h3>
								<h4>"I've always had a love for animals from a young age. I was brought up raising dogs, cats, chickens, owls, opossums, you name it. It only made sense to carry those skills over into adulthood and help others in taking care of their pets."
