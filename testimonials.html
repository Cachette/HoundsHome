										<h3>September 15, 2016</h3>
										<p>I'm so excited to have found such a wonderful pet sitter. My husband and I have always boarded our dogs in the past but with our female dog getting older we thought she'd be more comfortable at home. Our dogs are our babies and we felt nervous just leaving them at home while we went on vacation for 10 days. As soon as we checked into our hotel I checked my email and we already had pictures of the dogs. Brooke sent pictures every day and was extremely easy to contact. It was so nice to know that we were leaving our dogs in the care of people who truly love animals. We just got home and our dogs have been sitting by the front door all day, expecting Brooke and Cody to come over. They obviously enjoyed their time with you! Thank you so much Brooke & Cody for the wonderful care you guys provided for our dogs. We truly appreciate it. We will definitely be booking with you again!</p>

										<h3>August 17, 2016</h3>
										<p>Our needy dogs love Brooke and Cody! They are friendly and attentive, and followed our very detailed instructions well. We left for several days and came back to a home as clean as we left it, plus happy dogs. Can't ask for much more than that!</p>
